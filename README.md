### üåü Additional Utilities

- Includes <code>@aliases</code> for improved code navigation
- Utilizes various <code>utility</code> functions for easier development
- Features <code>Dark Mode</code> support
- Includes an <code>Auth Check</code> for protected pages
- Displays <code>loading indicators</code>loading indicators for data fetching

<code>Note:</code> You will need to set up Firebase and add your own Firebase configuration details in the .env file.

## Overview

This is an example of custom hook called <code>useRecords</code>  which uses <code>ReactQuery</code> to fetch all workout records from Firebase.

```ts
export const useRecords = () => {
	return useQuery('records', () => RecordsService.fetchAllRecords())
}
```

By abstracting the data fetching logic into a custom hook, we can reuse it across the app and keep our components lean and focused on their respective responsibilities.

```tsx
const DashboardPage: FC = () => {
	const { data: records, isFetched } = useRecords()

	const data = getRecordsData(records?.data)
	return (
		<Layout>
			<Statistics data={data} title='–ò–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏—è –æ —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∫–∞—Ö' />
			{isFetched ? <Calendar data={records} /> : <Loader centered />}
			<WorkoutPlan />
		</Layout>
	)
}
```

---

TThe <code>Heading</code> component is a reusable component that simplifies the process of creating headings in React application.

```tsx
	const Heading = size === 'leading' ? 'h1' : size === 'small' ? 'h3' : 'h2'
	return (
		<Heading
			className={classnames(styles.heading, className, {
				[styles.uppercase]: uppercase,
				[styles.centered]: centered,
				[styles.bold]: bold,
			})}
		>
			{children}
		</Heading>
	)
```

It uses a ternary operator to determine the size of the heading based on the <code>size prop</code> passed to it, and assigns the appropriate HTML heading element (h1, h2, or h3) to the Heading variable.

---

The <code>localeDate</code> function is a <code>utility function</code> that takes in a Date or a <code>Firestore Timestamp</code> object and returns a localized date string.

```ts
export const localeDate = (date: string | Timestamp): string => {
	if (typeof date === 'string') {
		return dayjs(date as string)
			.locale('ru')
			.format('D MMMM YYYY')
	}
	return dayjs(date?.toDate()).locale('ru').format('D MMMM YYYY')
}
```

This function can be used in various parts of the application where localized date strings are needed, such as in displaying workout records, user profiles, or calendar heatmaps.
